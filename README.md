# GreenRainFromMatrix
If this batch file is ran on windows OS (tested on Windows 10), a window will pop up and green rain will begin to populate the screen similarly to how the green rain looks in the Matrix movies.

Instructions: Just download the batch file and double-click.

Note: The screen sometimes flashes glitchily. I'm thinking the program is probably looping too often for the computer to comfortably keep up. I suppose batch files were not made for graphic displays. :)
